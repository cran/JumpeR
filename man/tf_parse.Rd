\title{Parses track and field data from Flash or Hytek format data into a data frame}
\usage{
tf_parse(
  file,
  avoid = avoid_default,
  typo = typo_default,
  replacement = replacement_default,
  relay_athletes = FALSE,
  rounds = FALSE,
  round_attempts = FALSE,
  split_attempts = FALSE,
  splits = FALSE,
  split_length = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a .pdf or .html file (could be a url) where containing track and
field results.  Must be formatted in a "normal" fashion - see vignette}

\item{avoid}{a list of strings.  Rows in \code{file} containing these strings
will not be included. For example "Record:", often used to label records,
could be passed to \code{avoid}.  The default is \code{avoid_default},
which contains many strings similar to "Record:".  Users can supply their
own lists to \code{avoid}.}

\item{typo}{a list of strings that are typos in the original results.
\code{tf_parse} is particularly sensitive to accidental double spaces, so
"Central  High School", with two spaces between "Central" and "High" is a
problem, which can be fixed.  Pass "Central  High School" to \code{typo}.}

\item{replacement}{a list of fixes for the strings in \code{typo}.  Here one
could pass "Central High School" (one space between "Central" and "High")
to fix the issue described in \code{typo}}

\item{relay_athletes}{should \code{tf_parse} try to include the names of
relay athletes for relay events?  Names will be listed in new columns
"Relay-Athlete_1", "Relay_Athlete_2" etc.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{rounds}{should \code{tf_parse} try to include rounds for
jumping/throwing events?  Please note this will add a significant number of
columns to the resulting data frame.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{round_attempts}{should \code{tf_parse} try to include rounds results
(i.e. "PASS", "X", "O") for high jump and pole value events?  Please note
this will add a significant number of columns to the resulting data frame.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{split_attempts}{should \code{tf_parse} split attempts from each round
into separate columns?  For example "XXO" would result in three columns,
one for "X', another for the second "X" and third for "O".  There will be a
lot of columns.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{splits}{either \code{TRUE} or the default, \code{FALSE} - should
\code{tf_parse} attempt to include splits.}

\item{split_length}{either the distance at which splits are collected
(must be constant distance) or the default, \code{1}, the length of track
at which splits are recorded.  Not all results are internally consistent on
this issue.  If in doubt use the default \code{1}}
